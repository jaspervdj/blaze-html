BlazeHtml is a blazingly fast HTML combinator library for the [Haskell]
programming language. It embeds HTML templates in Haskell code for optimal
efficiency and composability.  To get started, just

    cabal install blaze-html

[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

--- column2

The project is aimed at those who seek to write web applications in Haskell --
it integrates well with all Haskell web frameworks.

The best way to get started with BlazeHtml is to have a look at our [tutorial].
